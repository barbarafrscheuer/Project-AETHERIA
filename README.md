# 🌌 Project AETHERIA: Love, Language, and Learning!

**Fall in love and master a new language!** Project AETHERIA is a 2D dating simulation game where every romantic interaction, heart-fluttering date, and memorable conversation doubles as a crucial language lesson. Forget boring flashcards—here, your proficiency determines your love life!

If you're passionate about visual novels, dating sims, and innovative educational gaming, join us in building the next evolution of language learning!

### ✨ **Core Concept: Love Meets Language Acquisition**

Inspired by the engaging character-driven narrative of games like *Love and Deepspace*, AETHERIA weaves language mastery of **Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, or Korean** directly into the dating mechanics. The more you learn, the deeper your bond with your chosen paramour grows.

### 💖 **Gameplay & Learning Mechanics**

The game transforms language lessons into rewarding relationship milestones:

* **Dialogue Decisions:** Conversations are not just about choosing the right tone; they require selecting the **correct linguistic phrase or word** in the target language to earn affection points.
* **Integrated Spaced Repetition (ANKI-like):** We are building a sophisticated, in-game flashcard system. This system will dynamically generate and review vocabulary/grammar based on your conversation history and the needs of upcoming dates, making review sessions feel like preparing for a big romantic event!
* **Kanji/Kana/Hanja Challenge:** Dedicated mini-games featuring handwriting recognition (using a built-in canvas or external API) will require players to correctly draw characters to unlock special character stories or romantic CGs.
* **Affection = Proficiency:** The love level of the characters acts as the ultimate progress bar. **Your relationship cannot advance without proven language mastery.**

### 🎯 **The Goal**

To prove that learning a new language doesn't have to feel like a chore. Project AETHERIA aims to create a highly motivating, fun, and emotionally engaging environment where players **want** to learn the language to progress their relationships and unlock deeper connections with their love interests.
